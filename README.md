# PacMan Game

## Description
A simple PacMan game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can add PacMen, start and pause the game.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Click "Add PacMan" to create as many PacMen as you want.
4. Click "Start Game" to start the game or "Pause Game" to pause it.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
- Add more styles to the page for a better gaming experience.
- Include images of PacMen facing up and down, allowing them to move horizontally or vertically one at a time.
- Introduce obstacles on the map that randomly point left, right, up, or down. PacMen colliding with obstacles will change their direction accordinly.
